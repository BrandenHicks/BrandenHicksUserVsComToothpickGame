The user will take turn removing toothpicks in the game, with the goal of not picking the last toothpick (whoever picks the last toothpick looses). The game starts of with 31 total toothpicks and the player can pick between form 1 to 3 toothpicks per turn. This program uses basic algorithms and conditional statement in order to function. 

Instructions: 
1. gcc toothpickGame.c -o toothpick_game
2. ./toothpick_game

The game will start off with displaying the rules mentioned above. Once the user makes an input the computer will make its turn. The game will continue until the last toothpick is pulled, then the program will announce the loser of the game.
